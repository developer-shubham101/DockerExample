Deploying an HTML application (such as a static website) on Kubernetes involves several steps, from containerizing your application to setting up a Kubernetes deployment and exposing the application using a service. Here’s a step-by-step guide to deploying an HTML site on Kubernetes:

### Prerequisites:
- Kubernetes cluster (Minikube for local setup or any cloud provider like GKE, AKS, or EKS)
- `kubectl` installed and configured to interact with the cluster
- Docker installed (for creating a container image)

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. **Create Your HTML Application**
Let’s assume your HTML application has the following structure:
   ```
   my-website/
     ├── index.html
     └── styles.css
   ```

#### 2. **Create a Dockerfile**
You'll need to create a `Dockerfile` to package your HTML files into a container. You can use an NGINX web server to serve the static HTML content.

**Example `Dockerfile`:**
   ```Dockerfile
   # Use the official NGINX image as the base image
   FROM nginx:alpine

   # Copy the local HTML files to the NGINX default directory
   COPY ./my-website /usr/share/nginx/html

   # Expose port 80 for the web server
   EXPOSE 80
   ```

#### 3. **Build and Push the Docker Image**
- Build the Docker image with your HTML application:
  ```bash
  docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/my-website:1.0 .
  ```
- Push the image to Docker Hub or another container registry:
  ```bash
  docker push your-dockerhub-username/my-website:1.0
  ```

#### 4. **Create a Kubernetes Deployment**
A **deployment** in Kubernetes ensures that your application (container) is running. You’ll define the number of replicas, the image, and other settings in a YAML file.

**Example `deployment.yaml`:**
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: my-website-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 2  # You can change the number of replicas
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: my-website
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: my-website
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: nginx
           image: your-dockerhub-username/my-website:1.0
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
   ```

#### 5. **Expose the Application with a Service**
To make your application accessible, create a **service**. This service will route traffic to the pods running your HTML application. You can expose the service as a **NodePort** (for local testing) or use **LoadBalancer** in cloud environments.

**Example `service.yaml`:**
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: my-website-service
   spec:
     selector:
       app: my-website
     ports:
     - protocol: TCP
       port: 80  # Port accessible inside the cluster
       targetPort: 80  # Port on the container
     type: LoadBalancer  # Use NodePort for local clusters like Minikube
   ```

#### 6. **Deploy to Kubernetes**
Apply both the deployment and service to your Kubernetes cluster:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f service.yaml
   ```

#### 7. **Check the Deployment and Service**
- Verify that your deployment is running:
  ```bash
  kubectl get deployments
  ```
- Check that your pods are running:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```
- Verify that the service has been created and get the external IP (for cloud clusters) or NodePort (for Minikube):
  ```bash
  kubectl get services
  ```

#### 8. **Access Your HTML Application**
- For **cloud-based clusters** (with LoadBalancer), check the external IP and access the site via `http://<EXTERNAL-IP>`.
- For **Minikube** or local environments, you can retrieve the NodePort by running:
  ```bash
  minikube service my-website-service --url
  ```
Visit the returned URL in your browser to see your static HTML site running.

### Summary
In this workflow:
1. You create a Docker container to serve your HTML content using NGINX.
2. You define a Kubernetes deployment to manage your container.
3. You expose the application using a Kubernetes service.

Once deployed, Kubernetes will manage your application’s availability and can scale it if needed!
